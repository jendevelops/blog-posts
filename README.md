# File Naming Conventions

I'm assuming I'll eventually have a ton of blog posts, so to make my life for my future self easier, I'm going to be making a set of rules for naming conventions.

```
[Series Initials]_[Number].md
```

- Series Initials: Get from table below
- Number: number within the series. All series start at 1, unless it's a post introducing the series, which will be numbered 0.

## Series Names

| Series Name | Initial | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
|Bug Diaries | BD| Posts explaining the bugs that I've come accross and what they taught me|
|How To| HT | Posts with code examples explaining how to do something|
|Miscellaneous| MISC | One off posts that don't really have to do with any other extablished series|
